# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
    The search_pa_list function takes the user's question, finds a matching pattern, and then runs the question against the pattern

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
    I added After Hours to the movies.py file: It was made in 1985, and I added it because it's one of the most memorbale movies
    I've ever seen.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
    I added title_by_director_and year, which could be useful in the specificity it affords: it likely would turn up just one movie,
    so if you know when a movie was made and who directed it this could help you track down the name if you've forgotten it.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
    I would create a video game database chatbot, to serve the same purpose as this one but for a different form of media. It would function very similarly, except it would be hooked into a larger database of releases than just a file I put together myself.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
    The most difficult portion of this assignment was wrapping my head around the structure of the movie list.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
    Yes
